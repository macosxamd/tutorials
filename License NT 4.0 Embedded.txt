It looks like you're following a **manual process to modify the registry** for a **Windows Embedded OS** installation by loading and modifying registry hives, specifically the **SYSTEM** and **SYSTEM.ALT** files. This method is typically used for **customizing product settings** or **reconfiguring licensing** on Windows Embedded systems.

I’ll provide a step-by-step breakdown of the instructions, but please be **cautious** when modifying the registry, especially when dealing with SYSTEM-level files. Improper changes can render the system unbootable or cause other issues.

Here’s a more detailed guide for each step:

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Modifying the Registry for Windows Embedded OS**

#### **Step 1: Go to the Image Location**

1. **Navigate to** the location of your Windows Embedded OS image:

   * **Path**: `C:\EmbeddedOS`

   In this location, you should find the necessary files for the embedded OS, including the `SYSTEM` and `SYSTEM.ALT` files under the `\WINNT\System32\config` directory.

#### **Step 2: Go to `WINNT\System32\config`**

1. Open **File Explorer**.
2. Go to: `C:\EmbeddedOS\WINNT\System32\config`.
3. Look for the two **SYSTEM** files:

   * `SYSTEM` — This is the primary system registry hive.
   * `SYSTEM.ALT` — This is likely an alternate or backup registry hive.

#### **Step 3: Open `regedt32.exe`**

1. **Press Win + R**, type `regedt32.exe`, and hit **Enter**.

   This opens the **Registry Editor**, which allows you to modify the Windows registry.

#### **Step 4: Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**

1. In **Registry Editor**, expand the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` key on the left pane.

#### **Step 5: Click Registry > Load Hive...**

1. In the menu bar, go to **Registry > Load Hive...**.
2. This option allows you to load an offline registry hive (such as `SYSTEM`) into your current registry.

#### **Step 6: Go to the Location of `SYSTEM` / `SYSTEM.ALT`**

1. In the **Load Hive** window, navigate to the location where the `SYSTEM` or `SYSTEM.ALT` file is located:

   * `C:\EmbeddedOS\WINNT\System32\config`

#### **Step 7: Load `SYSTEM` and Give It a Name**

1. Select the `SYSTEM` file and click **Open**.
2. You will be prompted to **enter a name** for this loaded hive. You can name it something like `MyHive` or `EmbeddedHive` to easily identify it later.

#### **Step 8: Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > [Your Name] > ControlSet001 > Control > ProductOptions**

1. After loading the hive, it will appear under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` with the name you chose (e.g., `MyHive`).
2. Navigate to the following path:

   * **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > [Your Hive Name] > ControlSet001 > Control > ProductOptions**

   In the **ProductOptions** folder, you should see various registry values that control settings related to the product.

#### **Step 9: Double-click "ProductSuite"**

1. In the `ProductOptions` folder, look for the `ProductSuite` entry.
2. **Double-click** on `ProductSuite` to modify its value.

#### **Step 10: Change "Embedded Class: Temporary" to "Embedded Class: Class 2"**

1. In the value data box, you should see:

   * `Embedded Class: Temporary`
2. **Change the value** to:

   * `Embedded Class: Class 2`

   This step may be specific to configuring a different embedded class or version of the operating system.

#### **Step 11: Unload the `SYSTEM` Hive**

1. After modifying the `ProductSuite` value, **close** the `ProductOptions` registry key.
2. Go back to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** and right-click on the hive you loaded (e.g., `MyHive`).
3. Select **Unload Hive** from the context menu.

   This will unload the registry hive from your current session, ensuring that the changes are written and saved properly.

### **Step 12: Do the Same with the `SYSTEM.ALT` File**

1. Repeat **Steps 5 to 11** for the `SYSTEM.ALT` file:

   * **Load** the `SYSTEM.ALT` file into a new hive (give it a unique name).
   * Navigate to `ControlSet001 > Control > ProductOptions` in the newly loaded hive.
   * **Change** `Embedded Class: Temporary` to `Embedded Class: Class 2`.
   * **Unload** the `SYSTEM.ALT` hive once changes are made.

---

### **Step 13: Unload the `SYSTEM.ALT` Hive**

1. After you have finished modifying `SYSTEM.ALT`, go back to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**.
2. Right-click on the hive you just loaded (e.g., `MyHive_ALT`) and select **Unload Hive**.

---

### **Step 14: Deploy**

1. Now that the changes are made to both the **SYSTEM** and **SYSTEM.ALT** registry hives, **deploy** the image to your Windows Embedded device.

   You may need to perform a **reboot** or **reapply the image** depending on your setup.

---

### **Important Notes:**

* **Backup Your Registry**: Before making any registry changes, always **backup your registry** and your files to avoid any system corruption.

  * You can **export** the registry before loading a hive by selecting **File > Export** in **regedt32.exe**.

* **Editing ProductOptions**: Modifying `ProductOptions` to change the **embedded class** can impact the behavior of your **embedded OS**. Ensure that you understand the implications of the changes being made.

* **Testing**: After deploying the image, it’s a good idea to test the device to ensure that it boots and operates correctly with the new registry settings.
