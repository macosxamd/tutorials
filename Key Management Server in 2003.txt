1. Copy slsvc.exe to C:\System32\slsvc.exe
2. Create a service [ sc create "Software Protection" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\slsvc.exe" start= auto obj= "NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService" ]
3. Add description [ sc description "Software Protection" "Provides software protection and licensing functionality." ]
4. Verify creation [ sc qc "Software Protection" ]
5. Start the service [ net start "Software Protection" ]

🧱 Step-by-Step: Create the KMS SRV Record (Windows DNS)
1. Open DNS Manager

On your DNS server:

Press Win + R, type dnsmgmt.msc, and hit Enter.

In the left pane, expand your DNS zone (for example, yourdomain.local).

2. Create a New SRV Record

Right-click your zone → Other New Records…

Scroll down and choose Service Location (SRV) → click Create Record…

3. Fill in the SRV Record Details
Field	Value
Service	_vlmcs
Protocol	_tcp
Port number	1688
Host offering this service	kms.yourdomain.local (or the FQDN of your KMS host)

Click OK, then Done.

4. (Optional) Verify the Record

From any domain-joined client, run:

nslookup -type=srv _vlmcs._tcp.yourdomain.local


You should see your KMS host listed.

5. Confirm KMS Service Operation

On the KMS host, make sure the Software Protection Service is running:

net start sppsvc


Then check that port 1688 is listening:

netstat -ano | find "1688"

⚙️ Example Output

If everything’s correct:

Server:  dc01.yourdomain.local
Address:  10.0.0.10

_vlmcs._tcp.yourdomain.local  SRV service location:
          priority = 0
          weight = 0
          port = 1688
          svr hostname = kms.yourdomain.local
