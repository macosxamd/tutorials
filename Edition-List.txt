If your system has an OEM license installed by the manufacturer on the motherboard, then the Windows setup will not show the edition list and will automatically select the edition based on the license on the motherboard.
If you have such hardware and want to view the list of available editions for Windows installation, follow the steps below.
After flashing the required ISO using Rufus, navigate to the \sources\ folder on the USB drive and create a file named ei.cfg (ensure the file extension is correct). Open this file with Notepad and enter the text below.

Now you can view the edition list and pick the edition you want from Windows Vista to Windows 11. It also helps you avoid installing key in Windows 8/8.1 setup where key installation can not be skipped.
note
In Windows 11 24H2 (or newer), the new installer does not support this, so you need to select the "Previous version of the setup" option when the setup starts.

If you are using PID.txt, please note that it will take precedence over ei.cfg.
