Bypass Windows 11 Internet and Microsoft Account Requirements
Rufus offers an option to bypass the Internet and Microsoft Account requirements for installing Windows 11. However, if you prefer a different method, follow these steps:

When you see the "Let's connect you to a network" screen,
Press Shift + F10 to open a command prompt.
Type start ms-cxh:localonly and press Enter.
This allows you to continue the installation without needing to connect to the Internet or use a Microsoft account.
