Sure — here’s the **complete, detailed walkthrough** of the **Microsoft-documented registry method** (the “LabConfig” workaround) that lets you install **Windows 11 on unsupported hardware**.

This method is **officially allowed by Microsoft** for testing or evaluation and does **not involve modifying protected system files or bypassing activation** — it simply tells the installer to skip strict hardware requirement checks (like TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and CPU family).

---

## ⚙️ What This Workaround Does

During Windows Setup, it checks your hardware for:

* **TPM 2.0**
* **Secure Boot**
* **Supported CPU**
* **4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage**

If your PC fails any of these, Setup normally stops.
The `LabConfig` registry key tells Setup to **ignore those checks** and proceed.

## 🪟 Step-by-Step: Bypass Windows 11 Hardware Checks via Registry

### 1️⃣ Boot Into the Windows 11 Installer

1. Create a Windows 11 bootable USB (with Microsoft’s **Media Creation Tool** or ISO + Rufus).
2. Boot your computer from that USB.
3. At the first setup screen (language/keyboard selection), **press `Shift + F10`** to open **Command Prompt**.

You are now in a **WinPE** environment running inside Setup.

---

### 2️⃣ Open the Registry Editor

Type:

```cmd
regedit
```

and press **Enter**.

This launches **Registry Editor** inside the preinstallation environment.

---

### 3️⃣ Create the “LabConfig” Key

1. In Registry Editor, navigate to:

   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup
   ```
2. Right-click the **Setup** folder → **New → Key**.
3. Name the new key:

   ```
   LabConfig
   ```

---

### 4️⃣ Add the Bypass Values

Inside the **LabConfig** key, create the following **DWORD (32‑bit)** values:

| Value Name              | Type      | Data |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---- |
| `BypassTPMCheck`        | REG_DWORD | 1    |
| `BypassSecureBootCheck` | REG_DWORD | 1    |
| `BypassCPUCheck`        | REG_DWORD | 1    |

(If you also need to skip RAM or storage checks, you can optionally add:)

| Optional             | REG_DWORD | 1 |
| -------------------- | --------- | - |
| `BypassRAMCheck`     | REG_DWORD | 1 |
| `BypassStorageCheck` | REG_DWORD | 1 |

---

### 5️⃣ Close Registry Editor

When all values are added, close **Regedit** and then close the Command Prompt window.

---

### 6️⃣ Continue Installation

You’re back in the Windows 11 Setup wizard.
Click **Next**, then **Install now** — the setup will **skip hardware requirement checks** and continue like a normal installation.

---

## 🧾 Example of Command-Line (Optional Alternative)

If you prefer to do it all from the Command Prompt instead of using Regedit’s GUI, you can type:

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig" /v BypassTPMCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig" /v BypassSecureBootCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig" /v BypassCPUCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

(And optionally:)

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig" /v BypassRAMCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig" /v BypassStorageCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

Then close the Command Prompt and resume installation.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Microsoft Warning:** Installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware means you **may not receive updates** (especially feature updates).
* **Security features** (like TPM‑based encryption or Secure Boot validation) may not be active.
* **Always back up** your data before attempting this.

Would you like me to include a version of this workaround that you can run as an **automated script** (e.g., `cmd` batch file you can execute in WinPE before setup)?
